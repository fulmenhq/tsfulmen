# yamlfmt configuration for tsfulmen
# This file configures yamlfmt to match Fulmen YAML formatting preferences

formatter:
  type: basic
  indent: 2
  line_ending: lf
  # eof_newline: false - goneat's finalizer handles EOF normalization (single trailing newline)
  # so we don't need yamlfmt to add one (which would cause instability with multiline scalars)
  # retain_line_breaks_single: false - causes #magic___^_^___line markers in output, yamlfmt bug
  # Note: yamlfmt doesn't support all the options goneat tracks:
  # - quote_style (single/double)
  # - trailing_newline control
  # These would need to be enforced by other means or accepted as yamlfmt defaults

# Exclude patterns

  - node_modules/**
