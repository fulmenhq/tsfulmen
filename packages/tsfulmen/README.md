# @fulmenhq/tsfulmen Package

TypeScript implementation of the Fulmen helper library standard.

This directory will contain the source, tests, and build configuration for the published package once bootstrap is complete.

Planned structure:

```
src/
  index.ts
  ...
test/
  ...
```

Tooling (tsup, Bun, Biome, etc.) will be configured as part of Phase 0 in `.plans/tsfulmen-bootstrap.md`.
