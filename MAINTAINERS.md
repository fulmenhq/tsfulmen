## Governance Structure

- Human maintainers approve architecture, releases, and supervise AI agents.
- AI co-maintainers execute tasks, maintain documentation, and uphold library quality standards under supervision.
- See `REPOSITORY_SAFETY_PROTOCOLS.md` for guardrails and escalation paths.

## Cross-Language Coordination

TSFulmen coordinates with sibling helper libraries:

- **gofulmen** - Go implementation (reference)
- **pyfulmen** - Python implementation
- **Future**: rsfulmen (Rust), csfulmen (C#)

Weekly sync meetings ensure API alignment and shared standards compliance.
