# FulmenHQ Agentic Attribution Standard

**Standard**: Consistent attribution format for AI agent contributions to ensure transparency, accountability, and proper tracking in the FulmenHQ ecosystem.

## Purpose

Establish clear attribution patterns for FulmenHQ to enable:

- **Transparency** - Full visibility into AI agent contributions
- **Accountability** - Clear human supervision and responsibility chains
- **Technical Traceability** - Model, interface, and role identification for debugging
- **Quality Assurance** - Consistent standards across the ecosystem

## Attribution Elements

AI-assisted commits require three key elements:

| Element       | Purpose                              | Example                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Model**     | Which AI model generated the content | Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet, GPT-5.2 |
| **Interface** | Which agentic tool was used          | Claude Code, Cursor, Codex CLI          |
| **Role**      | What role the agent was operating as | devlead, secrev, entarch                |

## Standard Attribution Format

### Supervised Mode (Human Reviews Before Commit)

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body - what and why>

Changes:
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
- <specific change 3>

Generated by <Model> via <Interface> under supervision of @<maintainer>

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: <Human Name> <email> [@maintainer]
```

### Required Elements

1. **Generated by Line**: Model name, interface, and human supervisor
2. **Co-Authored-By**: Model name with `noreply@3leaps.net` email
3. **Role**: The role being operated as (from [Role Catalog](../catalog/agentic/roles/README.md))
4. **Committer-of-Record**: Human maintainer accountable for the commit (last line)
5. **Changes Section**: Bullet-pointed list of specific changes

### Trailer Order

Trailers MUST appear in this order:

```
Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Committer-of-Record: <Human> <email> [@handle]
```

## Autonomous Mode (Agent Operates Independently)

For autonomous agents with their own GitHub accounts:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

Changes:
- <change 1>
- <change 2>

Generated by <Model> via <Interface> (autonomous)

Co-Authored-By: <Model> <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: <role>
Autonomous-Agent: @<org>-agent-<role>
Escalation-Contact: @<maintainer>
```

### Distinguishing Modes

| Trailer                       | Mode       | Accountability                      |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Committer-of-Record: @human` | Supervised | Named human                         |
| `Autonomous-Agent: @bot`      | Autonomous | Organization via escalation contact |

## Email Domain

All Fulmen ecosystem agent attributions use `noreply@3leaps.net`:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>
```

Never use vendor-provided defaults (`noreply@anthropic.com`, `noreply@openai.com`).

Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

### Mistake 2: Missing Role Trailer

**Wrong**:

```

Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

**Correct**:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: devlead
Committer-of-Record: Dave Thompson <dave.thompson@3leaps.net> [@3leapsdave]
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Email Domain

**Wrong**:

```

**Correct**:

```
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>

### Mistake 4: Missing Committer-of-Record

**Wrong**:

```
Generated by Claude Opus 4.5 via Claude Code

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@3leaps.net>
Role: devlead
```

**Correct** (must include human accountability):

```
