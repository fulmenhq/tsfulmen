# Release v0.2.7 (2026-02-03)

**Release Type**: Infrastructure Fix

## Overview

Fixes automated GitHub release creation by replacing action-gh-release with gh CLI.

## What Changed

### Fixed

- **GitHub Release Automation** - Replaced softprops/action-gh-release@v2 with gh CLI
  - Previous releases (v0.2.4-v0.2.6) created at untagged URLs, not visible in releases list
  - Now uses `gh release create` for reliable, immediate publication
  - Simplified workflow appropriate for libraries (no draft/sign/undraft ceremony)

### Documentation

- **Incident Report** - Created docs/ops/incidents/2026-02-03-v0.2.5-release-failure.md
  - Full technical details of v0.2.5 failure
  - Timeline, root cause analysis, lessons learned
- **Release Notes Cleanup** - Simplified docs/releases/v0.2.6.md (moved details to incident report)
- **Publishing Guide** - Enhanced docs/publishing.md with ESM gotchas and CI timeout patterns

## Quality Gates

- Tests: ✅ 2107 passed | 16 skipped
- Lint: ✅ Clean
- TypeCheck: ✅ Clean
- `make verify-local-install`: ✅ PASSED
- `make verify-artifacts`: ✅ PASSED

## Migration

No code changes. Update normally:

```bash
npm install @fulmenhq/tsfulmen@0.2.7
```

---

**Pattern**: Libraries publish releases immediately (npm is source of truth). Executables use draft→sign→undraft for binary verification.
