# Release v0.2.5 (2026-02-03)

**Release Type**: CI/CD Fix

## Overview

This release fixes a bug in the automated release workflow's post-release verification job that was introduced in v0.2.4.

## What Changed

### Fixed

- **Release Workflow Post-Verification** - Fixed `ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED` error in verify job
  - Issue: v0.2.4's verify job used `require()` against tsfulmen, which is ESM-only
  - Solution: Updated to use dynamic `import()` instead
  - Impact: Post-release verification now correctly validates published npm packages

## Technical Details

### The Bug

The v0.2.4 release workflow added a post-release verification job that tested the published npm package by attempting to require it:

```javascript
require("@fulmenhq/tsfulmen");
```

However, tsfulmen is an ESM-only package (no CommonJS exports), so this resulted in:

```
ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED: Package subpath './package.json' is not defined by "exports"
```

### The Fix

Commit `41b9f88` updated the verification to use ESM imports:

```javascript
import("@fulmenhq/tsfulmen").then((tsfulmen) => {
  console.log("VERSION:", tsfulmen.VERSION);
  // ... version assertion
});
```

## Files Changed

- `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Updated verify job to use ESM imports

## Quality Gates

- ✅ Tests: All passing
- ✅ Lint: Clean
- ✅ TypeCheck: Clean
- ✅ Workflow: Validated

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Migration Guide

No migration required. This is a CI/CD infrastructure fix only.

## What's Next

v0.2.6 will include additional improvements based on learnings from the v0.2.4/v0.2.5 release cycle.
