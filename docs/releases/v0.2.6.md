# Release v0.2.6 (2026-02-03)

**Release Type**: Critical Bugfix  
**Supersedes**: v0.2.5 (broken)

## Overview

Critical bugfix release addressing ESM import errors and test timeouts that made v0.2.5 unusable.

## What Changed

### Fixed

- **ESM Imports** - Added `.js` extensions to ajv subpath imports (src/schema/validator.ts)
  - Fixes `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` when package installed via npm
  - Changed `ajv/dist/2019` → `ajv/dist/2019.js` and `ajv/dist/2020` → `ajv/dist/2020.js`

- **Test Timeout** - Added 5-second timeout to goneat spawn in isGoneatAvailable() (src/schema/goneat-bridge.ts)
  - Prevents indefinite hang in CI when goneat not in PATH
  - Test now completes in <2s instead of timing out after 60s

### Process Improvements

- **AGENTS.md** - Added CRITICAL section emphasizing RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md compliance before tagging
- **docs/publishing.md** - Added process discipline warning with v0.2.5 case study

## Notes

- v0.2.5 published with broken ESM imports, marked as deprecated on npm
- v0.2.6 includes both critical fixes plus process improvements

## Migration

No code changes required. v0.2.6 is a drop-in replacement for v0.2.5.

```bash
npm install @fulmenhq/tsfulmen@0.2.6
