# TSFulmen v0.1.8 Release Notes

**Release Date**: November 8, 2025  
**Release Type**: Infrastructure Upgrade + Quality Improvements  
**Status**: ✅ Released

## Summary

Implemented enterprise-grade remote-only sync infrastructure by upgrading goneat to v0.3.4 and migrating from deprecated `method: remote` to `force_remote: true` configuration. This release ensures reproducible builds regardless of local directory structure and strengthens the SSOT synchronization framework.

## Infrastructure Changes

### Goneat Upgrade (v0.3.3 → v0.3.4)

- Updated `.goneat/tools.yaml` with correct GitHub API checksums
- Verified proper installation and bootstrap functionality
- Enhanced tool verification with SHA256 checksum validation

### Remote-Only Sync Implementation

- Migrated `.goneat/ssot-consumer.yaml` from deprecated `method: remote` to `force_remote: true`
- Added `--force-remote` flag protection in `Makefile sync-ssot` target
- Confirmed provenance shows `forced_remote: true` and `forced_by: "flag"`
- Pinned to Crucible v0.2.8 with `method: "git_ref"`

## Quality Improvements

### Verification Tooling Fixes

Fixed TypeScript errors in `scripts/verify-published-package.ts`:

- Corrected `tmpdir` import from default to named import
- Fixed `run()` function return type for `Buffer | string` handling
- Added `'ignore'` to stdio type union
- Fixed missing `await` on `getSignalsVersion()` call
- Removed unused `existsSync` import

### Comprehensive Test Coverage

Created `scripts/__tests__/verify-published-package.test.ts` with 5 tests:

1. **TypeScript Compilation**: Validates script compiles without errors
2. **Async/Await Usage**: Checks all catalog functions are properly awaited
3. **VERSION Validation**: Ensures VERSION export checks exist
4. **Cleanup Logic**: Verifies proper finally block cleanup
5. **Stdio Options**: Validates correct stdio type definitions

Fixed `src/__tests__/build-artifacts.test.ts` to run `make build` before expecting `dist/` files.

## Build System Enhancements

### Makefile Protection

- Enhanced `sync-ssot` target with `--force-remote` flag
- Ensures remote-only sync behavior cannot be bypassed
- Integrated with existing quality gate workflow

### Bootstrap Reliability

- Verified goneat v0.3.4 installation via tools.yaml
- Confirmed hooks execute properly with local binary
- Added checksum verification for tool integrity

## Quality Metrics

- **Tests**: 1,569 passing (+99 new tests from remote sync validation)
- **TypeScript**: Zero compilation errors
- **Build**: Successful artifact generation with remote sync
- **Sync**: Force-remote configuration verified and operational
- **Coverage**: Verification tooling now has comprehensive test coverage

## Enterprise Benefits

### Reproducible Builds

- Remote-only sync eliminates local directory structure dependencies
- Consistent SSOT content across all development environments
- Pinned to specific Crucible version (v0.2.8) for stability

### Enhanced Security

- Checksum-verified tool downloads
- Force-remote prevents accidental local overrides
- Provenance tracking with audit trail

## Breaking Changes

**None** - All changes are infrastructure improvements and maintain full API compatibility.

## Verification

All quality gates passed:

1. ✅ Bootstrap: Goneat v0.3.4 installed with correct checksums
2. ✅ Formatting: All 322 files formatted with goneat
3. ✅ Type Checking: TypeScript compilation successful
4. ✅ Tests: 1,569 tests passed, 16 skipped (96 test files)
5. ✅ Build: Distributable artifacts generated successfully
6. ✅ Remote Sync: Force-remote configuration working correctly
7. ✅ Provenance: Pinned to Crucible v0.2.8 with `forced_remote: true`
