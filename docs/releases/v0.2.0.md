# TSFulmen v0.2.0 Release Notes

**Release Date**: 2026-01-13
**Release Type**: Infrastructure + Governance + SSOT
**Crucible Version**: v0.4.6

## Overview

TSFulmen v0.2.0 is a major infrastructure release that establishes the foundation for enterprise-grade operations. This release consolidates 22 commits of development work since v0.1.14, bringing role-based AI agent governance, supply chain security controls, and comprehensive Crucible SSOT updates.

## Highlights

- **Role-Based Agent Model** - Complete migration from named agent identities to functional roles per Crucible AI Agents Standard v2.0.0
- **Trust Anchor Bootstrap** - Cryptographic verification of toolchain via sfetch → goneat pyramid
- **Supply Chain Security** - Package cooling policy, license compliance, and dependency assessment
- **Crucible v0.4.6** - 9-role catalog, signal resolution fixtures, TUI design schemas, and OpenAPI coverage standard

## Breaking Changes

**None** - This release is fully backward compatible.

## New Features

### Signals Module Entry Point

New `@fulmenhq/tsfulmen/signals` export provides direct access to signal handling functionality:

```typescript
import {
  onShutdown,
  onReload,
  createSignalManager,
} from "@fulmenhq/tsfulmen/signals";

// Graceful shutdown handler
onShutdown(async () => {
  await cleanup();
});
```

### Embedded App Identity Fallback

Resilient identity discovery when `.fulmen/app.yaml` is not in the ancestor path. The system now checks embedded defaults before failing, enabling better out-of-the-box experience.

## Governance Changes

### Role-Based Agent Model

Migrated from named agent identities (e.g., "Module Weaver") to functional roles:

| Previous      | New Role   | Use Case                        |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Module Weaver | `devlead`  | Implementation, features, fixes |
| -             | `devrev`   | Code review, four-eyes audit    |
| -             | `infoarch` | Documentation, schemas          |
| EA Steward    | `entarch`  | Ecosystem coordination          |
| -             | `secrev`   | Security review                 |
| -             | `cicd`     | CI/CD automation                |
| -             | `dataeng`  | Data engineering                |
| -             | `prodmktg` | Product marketing               |
| -             | `uxdev`    | UX development                  |

```

### Updated Files

## Infrastructure

### Trust Anchor Bootstrap

New `scripts/make-bootstrap.sh` implementing the sfetch → goneat trust pyramid:

1. **sfetch** installed via published installer (trust anchor)
2. **sfetch self-verify** confirms cryptographic integrity
3. **goneat** installed via sfetch with minisign verification
4. **Foundation tools** installed via `goneat doctor tools --scope foundation`

This pattern is consistent with pyfulmen and rsfulmen bootstrap processes.

### Package Cooling Policy

New `.goneat/dependencies.yaml` enforces supply chain security:

```yaml
cooling:
  minimum_age_days: 7
  minimum_downloads: 100
  exceptions:
    - "@fulmenhq/*"
  enforcement: fail # Not alert-only
```

### License Compliance

- **Forbidden**: GPL, LGPL, AGPL, MPL, CDDL
- **Allowed**: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, ISC, Unlicense, CC0
- **Audit**: `make license-audit` generates `dist/reports/license-inventory.csv`

### Makefile Updates

- Adopted `GONEAT_RESOLVE` / `SFETCH_RESOLVE` patterns
- Bumped `GONEAT_VERSION` to v0.4.1
- Pre-push hooks now include `dependencies` category assessment
- All goneat invocations use consistent resolution logic

### Tools Configuration

`.goneat/tools.yaml` now includes foundation scope with:

- actionlint, ripgrep, jq, yq, bun, yamlfmt
- Platform-specific installer priorities

### YAML Formatting

Added `.yamlfmt` configuration for consistent YAML styling across the project.

## Crucible SSOT v0.4.6

### Role Catalog Expansion

Nine roles now available in `config/crucible-ts/agentic/roles/`:

- `devlead` - Implementation lead
- `devrev` - Code reviewer
- `infoarch` - Information architect
- `entarch` - Enterprise architect
- `secrev` - Security reviewer
- `cicd` - CI/CD automation
- `dataeng` - Data engineering
- `prodmktg` - Product marketing
- `uxdev` - UX development

### Signal Resolution Standard

New cross-language fixtures for signal handling validation:

- `config/crucible-ts/library/signals/fixtures/`
- Schema: `schemas/crucible-ts/library/signal-resolution-fixtures.schema.json`

### TUI Design System Schemas

New design system schemas in `schemas/crucible-ts/design/`:

- Color palettes and themes
- Typography scales
- Layout grids and spacing
- Component specifications

### OpenAPI Spec Coverage (ADR-0014)

Standard for API documentation coverage metrics:

- `docs/crucible-ts/architecture/decisions/adr-0014-openapi-spec-coverage.md`

### Ecosystem Branding

New branding configuration:

- `config/crucible-ts/branding/ecosystem.yaml`

### Similarity Module Promotion

Similarity module relocated to dedicated path:

- `config/crucible-ts/library/similarity/`

### Canonical URI Resolution

Standard for spec publishing and cross-repo references.

## Testing & Quality

### Test Results

All tests passing:

- Unit tests: Pass
- Integration tests: Pass
- Parity tests: Pass

### Quality Gates

- **lint**: Clean
- **typecheck**: Clean
- **license-audit**: No forbidden licenses
- **dependencies**: All policies satisfied

## Migration Guide

### From v0.1.x

No migration required. All changes are additive and backward compatible.

### Agent Configuration

If you were referencing named agent identities in automation:

```diff
- agent: "Module Weaver"
+ role: devlead
```

### Bootstrap Process

For new clones, use the updated bootstrap:

```bash
make bootstrap
```

This will use the trust anchor pattern automatically.

## Dependencies

## Known Issues

- CI/CD workflow has an unresolved issue preventing automated releases (being debugged)
