# Release Notes: v0.2.3

**Release Date**: 2026-01-28
**Release Type**: Security + DevDependency Update

## Vitest 4.x Upgrade - CVE Remediation

**Summary**: Upgrades vitest test framework from v2.1.9 to v4.0.18, eliminating 70 Go stdlib CVEs in dev/CI toolchain. No changes to shipped library code.

### Security Impact

The vitest 2.x/3.x dependency chain included vite 5.x, which bundled an esbuild binary compiled with Go 1.20.12. This Go version has multiple critical CVEs. Upgrading to vitest 4.x pulls vite 7.x with esbuild compiled on Go 1.25.5.

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Critical | 6 | 0 | -6 |
| High | 34 | 10 | -24 |
| Medium | 54 | 14 | -40 |
| **Total** | 94 | 24 | **-70** |

**Scope clarification**:
- **Production code surface**: 0 vulnerabilities
- **Dev/CI tooling**: 24 findings (all in esbuild binaries used by vitest/vite)

These vulnerabilities only affected dev/CI tooling (test runner), not the published library.

### Performance

Test suite execution improved by 32% (56s → 38s).
