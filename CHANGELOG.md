Updated `tsup.config.ts` to include submodule entries and added missing `./telemetry/http` export to `package.json`. Modules now build correctly and are accessible to consumers.

### Added

- **Package Integrity Validation** - Six automated validation scripts that run before publish to prevent incomplete packages:

  - `validate-tsup-config.ts` - Ensures tsup entries match package exports
  - `validate-source-modules.ts` - Detects source modules missing build configuration
  - `validate-package-contents.ts` - Validates npm pack structure completeness
  - `validate-imports.ts` - Simulates consumer imports to catch runtime errors
  - `validate-types.ts` - Verifies .d.ts files exist for all .js files
- **Makefile validation targets** - Individual and combined targets (`make validate-all`)
- **prepublishOnly hook integration** - Validation runs automatically before npm publish
- **Internal module markers** - `.no-export` files for intentional internal modules (exit-codes, signals, fulpack)

### Changed

  - Added optional peerDependencies for `@types/express` and `fastify`
  - Created `src/telemetry/http/types.ts` with cross-framework type interfaces
  - Replaced 13 undocumented `any` types with proper framework types
  - Express: `ExpressRequest`, `ExpressResponse`, `NextFunction`
  - Fastify: `FastifyInstance`, `FastifyRequest`, `FastifyReply`, `FastifyPluginCallback`
  - Bun: Native `Request`/`Response` types
  - Retained 5 justified `any` casts with documentation for Fastify runtime properties

## [0.1.10] - 2025-11-17

### Fixed

- **Critical: Signal catalog loading in installed packages** - Fixed path resolution bug that prevented signals catalog from loading when package was installed via npm. The bundled code in `dist/foundry/index.js` was using incorrect relative paths (`../../../config` instead of `../../config`) due to tsup bundling behavior. Added runtime path detection to handle both development (source files) and production (bundled files) contexts.
- **Pre-publish verification** - Added `scripts/verify-local-install.ts` and `make verify-local-install` target to catch path resolution bugs before publishing. This script packs the package locally, installs it to a temp directory, and tests catalog loading in the installed context.

### Added

- Runtime path detection in signals catalog loader (src/foundry/signals/catalog.ts:23-30)
- Pre-publish integration test (scripts/verify-local-install.ts)
- Makefile target `verify-local-install` for pre-publish verification

### Changed

- Signals catalog path resolution now detects whether running from source (`src/`) or dist (`dist/`) and adjusts paths accordingly

---

## [0.1.9] - 2025-11-16 [DEPRECATED - Non-functional]

**⚠️ DO NOT USE**: This version has a critical bug where catalog loading fails in installed packages. Use v0.1.10 or later.

### Added

- **Fulpack Module** (`@fulmenhq/tsfulmen/fulpack`) - Security-first archive operations for TAR, TAR.GZ, ZIP, and GZIP formats
  - **Five Canonical Operations**:
    - `create()` - Create archives from files/directories with configurable compression
    - `extract()` - Extract archives with comprehensive security checks
    - `scan()` - List archive contents without extraction (Pathfinder integration backend)
    - `verify()` - Validate archive integrity and security before extraction
    - `info()` - Get quick archive metadata (format, size, compression ratio)
  - **Security-First Design**:
    - Path traversal protection (rejects `../` and absolute paths)
    - Decompression bomb detection (size/ratio/entry count limits)
    - Symlink safety validation (prevents directory escapes)
    - Checksum verification via fulhash integration (SHA-256, xxh3-128)
  - **Four Archive Formats**:
    - TAR (uncompressed) - Maximum speed for pre-compressed data
    - TAR.GZ (gzip) - General purpose with best compatibility
    - ZIP (deflate) - Windows compatibility and random access
    - GZIP - Single file compression
  - **Pathfinder Integration**: `scan()` serves as backend for archive discovery
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Full API reference, security guide, format selection guide, and usage examples
  - **Test Coverage**: 20 tests covering all operations and security checks
  - **Error Handling**: Structured `FulpackOperationError` with operation context and security violation details

- **Pathfinder Repository Root Discovery** (`findRepositoryRoot`) - Secure upward traversal to find repository markers
  - **Security-First Design**:
    - Boundary enforcement (home directory/explicit/filesystem root)
    - Max depth limiting (default 10 levels)
    - Symlink loop detection (opt-in with `followSymlinks=true`)
    - Path constraint validation for workspace boundaries
    - Cross-platform support (POSIX root, Windows drives, UNC paths)
  - **Predefined Marker Sets**: GitMarkers, NodeMarkers, PythonMarkers, GoModMarkers, MonorepoMarkers
  - **Flexible Search**: Stop at first marker (default) or find deepest (monorepo root)
  - **Helper Functions**: `withMaxDepth`, `withBoundary`, `withStopAtFirst`, `withConstraint`, `withFollowSymlinks`
  - **Comprehensive Errors**: Structured errors with codes (REPOSITORY_NOT_FOUND, INVALID_BOUNDARY, TRAVERSAL_LOOP, etc.)
  - **Test Coverage**: 26 tests covering security, boundary enforcement, and cross-platform behavior
  - **Complete Documentation**: Full pathfinder README with API reference, safe usage patterns, and migration guide

  - Fixed incorrect default import for `tmpdir` from `node:os`
  - Corrected `run()` function return type to handle `Buffer | string`
  - Added `'ignore'` to stdio type union
  - Removed unused `existsSync` import
- **Missing await on async catalog functions**: Added proper `await` to `getSignalsVersion()` call in verification script
- **Build Artifacts Test Failure**: Fixed test expecting built `dist/` artifacts by ensuring build runs before tests

### Added

- **Unit Tests for Verification Script**: Created `scripts/__tests__/verify-published-package.test.ts` with 5 tests
  - Validates TypeScript compilation
  - Checks async/await usage for all catalog functions
  - Verifies VERSION export validation logic
  - Ensures proper cleanup in finally block
  - Validates stdio options correctness
- **Remote-Only Sync Configuration**: Updated `.goneat/ssot-consumer.yaml` with new `force_remote: true` field
  - Replaces deprecated `method: remote` with standardized `force_remote: true`
  - Ensures CI/CD and fresh clones always use remote Crucible v0.2.8
  - Prevents accidental local sync from `../crucible` directories

### Changed

- **Goneat Upgrade**: Updated from v0.3.3 to v0.3.4 with new force-remote capabilities
- **SSOT Configuration**: Migrated to new goneat v0.3.4 schema with `force_remote` field support
- **Makefile Sync Target**: Uses `--force-remote` flag to override any local auto-detection
- **Provenance Tracking**: Enhanced provenance metadata shows `forced_remote: true` and `forced_by: flag`

### Meta

- Addresses the "chicken and egg" problem: verification tooling now has its own verification tests
- Ensures code quality checks are not dismissed - all TypeScript errors resolved
- Guarantees reproducible remote syncs for all users regardless of local directory structure

---

## [0.1.7] - 2025-11-06

**Release Infrastructure** - Automated version consistency checks and workflow improvements to prevent version drift.

### Fixed

- **VERSION Constant Drift**: VERSION exported from code now automatically synchronized with package.json
  - Enhanced `scripts/version-sync.ts` to update `src/index.ts` VERSION constant
  - Added VERSION consistency verification to `scripts/verify-package-artifacts.ts`
  - Prevents mismatch between package.json version and runtime VERSION export (issue found in v0.1.6)

### Changed

- **Makefile Improvements**:
  - Updated `prepush` target to run `fmt` before `check-all`
  - Ensures formatting is applied before quality checks
- **Bootstrap Process**: Verified `./bin/goneat` installation via tools.yaml download method works correctly

### Infrastructure

- Pre-publish artifact verification now validates VERSION consistency
- Automated version synchronization across package.json and source code
- Improved release workflow to catch version drift issues early

**Note**: v0.1.6 was published to npm but had VERSION constant mismatch (package.json: 0.1.6, exported: 0.1.5). GitHub release v0.1.6 was removed. This release fixes that infrastructure gap.

---

## [0.1.6] - 2025-11-06

**Skipped** - Published to npm but not released on GitHub due to VERSION constant mismatch discovered post-publish. See v0.1.7 for details and fixes.

### Issues

- VERSION constant exported `'0.1.5'` while package.json declared `0.1.6`
- GitHub release removed; npm package remains but is not recommended
- Users should upgrade to v0.1.7 or later
