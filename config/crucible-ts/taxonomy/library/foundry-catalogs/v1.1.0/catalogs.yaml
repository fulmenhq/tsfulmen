# Fulmen Foundry Reference Data Catalogs
# THE canonical SSOT for foundry reference data catalogs
# These are data catalogs, NOT code modules (see platform-modules for code)
# Manually maintained but automatically validated
#
# v1.1.0 CHANGES:
# - Added weight (light/heavy) for dependency footprint classification
# - Added default_inclusion (true/false) for feature gate defaults
# - Added feature_group for library feature gate mapping
# - REMOVED similarity (promoted to platform-modules as standalone module)
