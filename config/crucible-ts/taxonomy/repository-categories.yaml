# Fulmen repository category taxonomy (machine-readable source)
version: "2026.01.1"
categories:
  - key: cli
    summary: "Command-line utilities without long-lived servers"
    primaryEntryPoints:
      - "Executable binary (Cobra/Click/etc.)"
      - "make targets"
    typicalConsumers:
      - "Developers"
      - "CI/CD pipelines"
    notes: "Outputs data to STDOUT, diagnostics to STDERR"
  - key: microtool
    summary: "Ultra-narrow, single-purpose CLI deployment/automation tool"
    primaryEntryPoints:
      - "Executable binary (single command or minimal subcommands)"
    typicalConsumers:
      - "CI/CD pipelines"
      - "Deployment automation"
      - "Internal tooling"
    constraints:
      - "MUST have single primary purpose (e.g., fixture deployment)"
      - "MUST be written in Go, TypeScript/Bun, or Rust only (no other languages)"
      - "SHOULD import helper library (gofulmen, tsfulmen, or rsfulmen)"
      - "If helper library is NOT imported, MUST NOT recreate any helper functionality (exit codes, logger, signals, config loading must be implemented independently without copying helper patterns)"
      - "MUST obey exit codes, signals, logger, config standards (whether from helper or independent implementation)"
      - "MUST NOT export packages or library interfaces (no pkg/ exports)"
      - "MUST NOT have web server endpoints"
      - "MUST NOT be imported by other repositories (one-way dependency only)"
      - "MUST remain narrow in scope (if tool grows multi-purpose, promote to cli category)"
    languages:
      - "Go (preferred for binary size and ecosystem)"
      - "TypeScript/Bun (compiled to binary)"
      - "Rust (when rsfulmen stable)"
    notes: "Microtools enforce architectural discipline through narrow scope and helper library dependency. One-way dependency flow (microtool → helper → SSOT) prevents circular dependencies. CDRL templates follow naming: forge-microtool-{instrument} where {instrument} uses hand tools/precision instruments with first letter matching language (grinder/gauge/gouge for Go, tongs/tap/trammel for TypeScript, rasp/reamer/router for Rust) - distinguishes from workhorse (horse breeds)."
    examples:
      - "fulmen-fixtures (fixture deployment and generation)"
    templateNaming:
      pattern: "forge-microtool-{instrument}"
      note: "First letter of instrument matches implementation language (Go=G, TypeScript=T, Rust=R)"
      instruments:
        - "grinder (Go - heavy processing)"
        - "gauge (Go - measurement/validation)"
        - "gouge (Go - data extraction)"
        - "tongs (TypeScript - data handling)"

    notes: >
      Missive repositories favor vanilla HTML/CSS with zero build. Escalate to Codex when multi-page, search, or content collections are needed.

    notes: >
      Spec-host repositories host self-describing specifications where assets contain embedded canonical IDs ($id, x-fulmen-id) that must resolve over HTTPS. Assets are validated against industry-standard meta-schemas (JSON Schema, OpenAPI, AsyncAPI). For path-addressed assets without embedded IDs, see doc-host.

    notes: >
      Doc-host repositories host path-addressed assets where canonical URLs are derived from file paths, not embedded identifiers. No meta-validation against industry-standard specifications is required. Suitable for Markdown docs, YAML configs, and reference data. For self-describing specifications with embedded IDs, see spec-host.

    notes: >
      Fixtures are real implementations with test-purpose configuration, NOT mocks (simulated responses). They execute real logic with synthetic data. Security constraints are inviolate to prevent data exposure in test artifacts. All fixture names must be registered in config/taxonomy/fixture-catalog.yaml.

      pattern: "fixture-{mode}-{category}-{name}-{variant}"
