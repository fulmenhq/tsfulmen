# Scripts

Automation helpers for the tsfulmen repository.

- `crucible-pull.ts` (planned) will mirror Crucible's reference script to vendor SSOT assets into `assets/crucible/`.
- Additional bootstrap scripts (e.g., tool installers) should live here to keep the root tidy.

All scripts should be cross-platform and Bun-compatible where possible.
