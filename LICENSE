## Trademark Notice

"3 Leaps®" is a registered trademark of 3 Leaps, LLC, a Florida LLC with offices in South Carolina. "Fulmen™", "Fulmens™", "FulmenHQ™", "MDMeld™", "Docemist™", the "Fulmen logo™", the "MDMeld icon™", and the "Docemist logo™" are trademarks of 3 Leaps, LLC, claimed through use in commerce, with plans for USPTO registration.

While code and documentation are open under the MIT License above, use of these trademarks and associated logos, icons, and visual elements is reserved for official implementations to prevent confusion and protect the ecosystem. Use of these marks in derivative works does not imply endorsement by 3 Leaps, LLC.

## Acceptable Use of "Fulmen"

"Fulmen" (Latin for lightning or thunderbolt) is a reusable project template by 3 Leaps, LLC, designed for lightning-fast, enterprise-grade solutions. Use "Fulmen" as a standalone noun (for example, "Use a fulmen to start your project") and avoid descriptors like "template" or "blueprint." We encourage referencing "fulmen" in contexts identifying permissibly licensed content, provided the `3leaps-` prefix is not used to avoid confusion with official 3 Leaps content. As a courtesy, acknowledge the origin by linking to `https://github.com/fulmenhq/fulmen-cosmography` in your documentation. For full branding guidelines, visit `https://fulmenhq.dev`.
